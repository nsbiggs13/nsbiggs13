### About me:
  I grew up in an old retired Gold Mining town in the Sierra Nevada mountains in Northern California.  There began my obsession with the many rivers and lakes.  A day out on the lake water skiing on smooth water continues to be where I find my happy place (Happy Gilmore).  I was a pole vaulter  in High School and College and thought I wanted to be a high school science teacher and coach track and field.  I soon found myself falling into the adrenaline rush of emergency medicine and got my EMT license and later became a nurse.  After years of hard service I'm ready to turn my focus to my curosity and dip into the pools of IT.  With so many options to choose from I have yet to find my path but it has been an adventure and a refreshing challenge trying to find where it will take me.
  
Currently learning:
  SQL, Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Tableau, Power BI, Visual Studio, and how to improve as a husband, father, and human being.
  
Fun Fact:
  I'm one of the most unique person's in the world... Red hair and Blue eyes, the most rare combination of hair and eye color.
